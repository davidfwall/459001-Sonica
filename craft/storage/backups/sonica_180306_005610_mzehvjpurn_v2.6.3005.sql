Other features include the herringbone flooring which seamlessly combines durability with design, the increasingly popular crittal glazing and bespoke joinery throughout. In addition, you will find numerous design touches, as you would expect of an RKD interiors design, such as the exposed swag cabling to the lights in the cafe to give the illusion of extra height, the plywood routered RKD logo at entry with integrated shelving and the comfortable lounge located midway through the ground floor.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The project was delivered in 5 weeks following a 1-week pre-construction and mobilisation period.<\\/p>\",\"60\":\"<ul><li>Bespoke feature joinery and glazed partition packages<\\/li><li>Numerous floor finishes running seamlessly throughout<\\/li><li>Staff \\u201cCafe\\u201d<\\/li><li>Internal, secure bike park<\\/li><li>2 floors of bright, modern studio space<\\/li><li>M&E and IT upgrades throughout<\\/li><li>Turnkey furniture package<\\/li><\\/ul>\",\"63\":[\"451\"],\"56\":\"Ballsbridge, Dublin 4\",\"64\":[\"450\",\"451\",\"452\",\"453\",\"454\",\"455\",\"456\"],\"61\":\"Working with Sonica was a great experience.

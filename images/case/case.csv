Our brief took the project from an existing Landlord CAT-A finish (which was fully stripped out) to their fitted out Corporate HQ in 8 weeks from commencement.

Works were undertaken in a multi-tenanted office development with continual intensive daily co-ordination with the sitting Building Management Team. Added to the time sensitive nature of the project was the Client’s “not-to-exceed” occupation date which was a key consideration in our aggressive construction programme.

The project scope also included a large specialist joinery component, extensive meeting spaces with feature exposed ceilings and feature lighting throughout, bespoke reception area, feature hard and soft floorings, substantial active IT solution, a fully redundant IT backbone install to main comms room, high-end Corporate level access control and security install, A/V delivery and a full furniture installation across the complete floor plate.","1,500m2","1-week Pre-construction

The company were acquired by US game publisher Activision Blizzard in 2007 and have offices in Dublin, Vancouver and Shanghai.

Due to the complexity of the works and the fact that the offices would remain LIVE through the refurbishment, the project was bid on a 2-stage basis with an open tender process to identify two preferred bidders followed by a post-tender interview process to select their final fitout partner. A large part of the Client Team’s decision making process also centered on input and commentary from the Contractor into the initial scheme design with recommendations on buildability and value engineering. We were suitably delighted to win out at interview stage and be appointed as Demonware’s contractor of choice – with us on board, planning for their new European HQ officially kicked-off led by international architects, Urban Agency.

The scope of works included segregation of the existing floor plate into Live / Under-Construction areas, the complete strip of the demised floor areas, full M&E, IT and A/V installation, a bespoke fabricated solution for Meeting Rooms (made from curved glass pods) and Team Huddle Rooms (machined birch faced plywood), full soft & hard flooring, extensive graphics package and the management & supervision of the Client’s furniture vendors. Of further note was the fact that the project was completed with the Client in full occupation on the 5th Floor of a multi-tenanted building.

100 Stephen’s Green,Dublin 2,"100 St. Stephen’s Green, a red brick Georgian located in the iconic South West corner of the Green, was originally sub-divided into six dated apartments.

The nature of the premises, and it’s status as a listed building, meant the project had to be handled with the utmost care.

The work scope included full glazing replacement with all new sliding sash windows with slimlite double glazed panels in keeping with the original, full facade restoration and re-pointing, roof replacement, extensive structural works, removal of the existing basement slab and replacement with complete tanking system and new drainage and fire protection to existing staircore as per current regulations.

The team, led by Justin Treacy, consists of the very best in creative Architects and Interior Designers who work collaboratively with the in-house support team of Designers, Technicians & CAD / BIM Coordinators and the wider resource and expertise of RKD Architects. At the core of their philosophy is a practical and pragmatic approach to delivering the best environments for the most appropriate capital outlay. Having worked with RKD Interiors on numerous occasions in the past, we were aware of the exacting standards that were expected from the outset on this collaboration.

The project was pitched as a real shop window fitout to showcase RKD’s standard and design capability to prospective visiting RKD Clients and we approached the project like any other: to deliver best in market product with zero defects at handover. Covering 6,000 sq ft over 3 floors, the work scope comprised of inspirational studios to the 1st and 2nd floors, with areas designated for collaboration and huddle meetings allowing the designers to get creative with a bespoke staff café, meeting rooms and social spaces based on the Ground Floor.

The overall brief was to produce a comfortable, modern and above all functional workspace with a professional design that exceeds expectations even in an area such as Baggot St. where high end eateries and businesses are the norm. One of the key features, as part of RKD interiors on-going commitment to a greener work environment, was to provide ample, secure bike storage for staff. Not only has this been achieved but it has also become a real design focal point, which upon entry sets a modern and progressive tone. Other features include the herringbone flooring which seamlessly combines durability with design, the increasingly popular crittal glazing and bespoke joinery throughout. In addition, you will find numerous design touches, as you would expect of an RKD interiors design, such as the exposed swag cabling to the lights in the cafe to give the illusion of extra height, the plywood routered RKD logo at entry with integrated shelving and the comfortable lounge located midway through the ground floor.

Nissan,Dublin,"Nissan has been at the forefront of the Irish motor industry since their arrival into Ireland in 1977, a feat that is achieved by a potent combination of aggressive sales and marketing strategies coupled with an extremely strong customer service philosophy.

As part of their continual commitment to maintaining top-end customer experiences in their network of dealer garages, the Company embarked on a programme of refurbishment on four of their flag-ship premises in Deansgrange, Liffey Valley, Airside Swords and Tallaght. We were delighted to be selected by Nissan and their extended Professional Team to carry out this exciting multi-location works programme.

The works centred on the strip out and replacement of key features and finishes in the existing garages to raise their already impressive profiles. This was achieved by the introduction of a new bespoke A/V installation, a feature lighting overhaul, addition of glazed meeting rooms for customer interaction, a total hard-flooring uplift and replacement, new joinery, soft furnishings and a full redecoration to create a completely new look-and-feel.

The biggest challenge was to carry out these works, against 4-separate and standalone aggressive installation programmes, whilst the garages remained open for business during the refurbishment process.
